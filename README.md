## Connect Your Domain

After hosting, go to your domain registrar (where you bought nmdetailing.org) and add:

- **A Record:** @ → your hosting IP (Netlify will show this)
- **CNAME:** www → your-netlify-site.netlify.app

- Tell me and I can set up a simple link-in-bio style page

Let me know when you've hosted it and I'll help connect the domain!
